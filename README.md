# Java-Programming
This repository contains homework assigned by class “Java Promgramming” of Information System Training Program of NTU and the final exam projects. 

##	Homework<br>
*	HW1 : 
Let x be any real number. Write a program which calculate the square root of x by using Bisection method. You may use a while loop for this problem. The function Math.pow and Math.sqrt are not allowed.

*	HW2 : 
Write a program for number guessing. The program asks the user to enter an integer from (0, 99). Then the program updates the range depending on the input accordingly. If the input value is equal to the secret number, then the user wins. If there is only one integer left, then the user loses the game. Make sure that the user enters a number in the feasible range. If not, ask the user to redo the input.

*	HW3 : 
Randomly produce ten integers (between -100 and 100), sort them with bubble sort and insertion sort.

*	HW4 : 
Randomly produce ten integers (between -100 and 100), sort them with merge sort, and compare the performance of selection sort, bubble sort, insertion sort and merge sort.

*	HW5 : 
Let x be any real number and n be any integer (n can be negative). Write a program which calculates x ^ n by recursion. For example, 2 ^ -10 = 0.000976. Try to make your program run in O(log | n |) time. Note that you are not allowed to use Math.pow and for/while loops in your solution.

##	Final Exam Projects<br>
*	Problem1 : 
Modify the following program which seems not to terminate properly.(omitted)

*	Problem2 : 
Write a program which outputs the following pattern: (omitted)
   
*	Problem3 : 
Let x be any positive integer. Write a program which sums over all the digits of x. For example, x = 123456. Then the output is 21. You cannot enter x by entering single digits sequentially (using nextInt() by couples of times).

*	Problem4 : 
Write two programs which determine if the input string is a palindrome: one is to use a loop and the other is implemented by recursion.

*	Problem5 : 
Write two programs that one converts a positive decimal number to a binary number, and the other converts a binary number to a positive decimal number.

*	Problem6 : 
Write a program which outputs the greatest product of 3 integers among a set of integers (could be positive and negative). Note that it is not necessary to be the product of 3 consecutive integers in the set. Make your solution run faster than the naive approach which runs in O(n^3) time.

*	Problem7 : 
Write a recursive function which calculates the nth Fibonacci number in O(n) time. You cannot use any loop.
